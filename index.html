  <h2 id="intro">who is iyowa? ✦ . 　⁺ </h2>

  <p>
    iyowa is a highly celebrated vocaloid producer (for more on vocaloid, 
    <a class="link" href="https://laguardia-webdev-2024.github.io/2-p-unit-2-project-silly-camilo/" target="_blank">
      see my previous website)!
    </a> 
    he is known for his use of dissonance in his songs to create an incredible emotional
    atmosphere. many of his songs have themes of nostalgia and mourning the passage of
    time and loss of childhood. his songs are usually heartwrenching, a kaleidescope of
    striking melodies and poetic lyrics. additionally, he illustrates and animates his
    own music videos and designs characters for each of them! they're known as "iyowa girls"
    and he has a very beautiful and sweet art style. he makes use of limited
    color palettes to give each of his music videos an instantly
    unique visual identity. his songs on their own are so powerful,
    but alongside the music videos he truly connects with his audience and
    weaves a powerful narrative every time. it goes without saying that he is an incredibly talented individual!
  </p>
  <p>
    a fun fact is that his name comes from the phrase "<strong>i</strong> ga <strong>yowa</strong>i" meaning weak stomach. 
    his little icon and persona for himself is a simplified illustration of a stomach with a small smiley face.

  <h2 id="lyrics"> song info & lyrics analysis ✦ . 　⁺ </h2>
<p>
  the official english translation of the title “netsu ijou” is <em> 
  heat abnormal. </em> however, a more accurate translation would be 
  <em> thermal anomaly. </em> <br>
  for the vocal, iyowa used the UTAU 
  adachi rei! she gives the song a very crunchy, robotic filtered 
  sound, which is absolutely perfect for the themes and even setting 
  that this song explores! her use here gave her voicebank a lot of 
  recognition. <br>
  this song has become a huge sensation, garnering many 
  covers (across languages!), remixes, fan art / music videos, and 
  more! i find all of this to be extremely well deserved! it makes me 
  so deeply happy to see so many people connecting with this song 
  just as strongly as i do! time and again i find that the vocal 
  synth community is incredibly creative and talented, and the many 
  wonderful, unique derivatives of this beautiful song are even more 
  proof of that. (´ω｀) ♡
</p>

  <p>
    the popular consensus about this song is that it's
    about the end of the world.
    that being said, it's jam packed with devastating,
    poetic lyrics that everyone will interpret
    in their own ways! because there is so, so much to say
    about this song, i will keep it short and focus
    only on my favorite lines and what they mean to me! (´ ˘ `) <br>
    the credits for the translation i used come from the

<p>
  the song opens with this verse, illustrating utter loneliness and futility.
  it sets the tone that the singer is leaving messages for nobody. it's so interesting to note
  that the lyrics of the song begin with open quotations, and the song ends by finally closing
  them. this, alongside the imagery of a walkie-talkie in the music video, appear to convey 
  that the entire song is a recorded message, <em>"a pitiful soliloquy."</em>
</p>
<p>
  this idea of repeatedly counting dead variables makes me think of
  someone seeking solace in calculating different possibilities, even though they
  all ultimately don't lead anywhere. many of the songs lyrics carry this weight
  of futility and hopelessness.

<p>
  this song is full of repeating phrases at the end of each verse. 
  following the idea of the song being a recorded message, the
  repetition could indicate the playback glitching out or buffering.
  this adds to this feeling of abandonment and desolation built
  throughout the lyrics and setting of the song. <br>
  additionally the use of repetition serves to PUNCH ME IN THE GUTS EMOTIONALLY.
  there's just something so powerful about repeating a phrase in 
  a song that heightens the emotions SO MUCH and makes me want to bash
  my head into a wall!!!!!! it forces the listener to really FEEL the lyric 
  and all the weight and meaning it holds. its like the words are BASHING YOU 
  WITH A HAMMER it's amazing.
</p>

<p>
  anyway on to the actual content of this verse. i just find it soooo ouchy ouch painful it's hard
  to even put into words but i will try!!! <br>
  setting fire to the flag of salvation again carries forward this idea of utter hopelessness.
  the people felt that their flag was false, that it couldn't be trusted, 
  and that it wouldn't save them at all. they are left with no symbol of hope to 
  look towards. they are lost and hurt and angry. <br>
  then there's the skeletons. there's so much to say here auuuuu!!!! I LOVE THIS SONG OMG ok so
  you would think skeletons are dead, but they're clearly still conscious. they come out of their
  coffins to celebrate the things they cherish, only to be filled with
  shame and try to behave as they should (which is to be dead) once more.
</p>

<p>
  obviously it's my own biased, silly little nonsensical interpretation, but i relate
  to these skeletons so much. this idea of trying to suppress yourself (<em>shutting themselves 
  in coffins</em>) and of feeling so much shame and self-depreciation (<em>there's something
  wrong with me</em>) is just so reaaaaaaaaaal. you can't help but be the self that you despise,
  even as you try to keep yourself in line. you can't help but live no matter how hard you try to die.
  <br> ouuuuuumygawd I LOVE THESE LYRICS ARGHHGRHRGHR
  i've heard many people agree that this song feels like a mental spiral, 
  and i agree so hard!! i find that the last part 
  of this verse could NOT be a more
  PERFECT encapsulation of that.
</p>

<p>
  ultimately the burned flag and the skeletons together illustrate a theme
  of death and blame. i think there's an interesting contrast between
  the people crying in a loud voice and the skeletons only speaking in
  a whisper. there's also the fact that the people are in a large
  group putting blame on something bigger than themselves, whereas
  the skeletons are isolated in their coffins and put blame on their
  own selves. perhaps it shows that in desperate circumstances,
  everyone experiences their pain differently. they might externalize
  it or internalize it, use it to fight or to weep.<br>
  there's also the matter of "salvation" alongside the 
  ideas of death. it brings to mind the end of times,
  perhaps an apocalyptic judgement day of sorts. 
  all this is to say that this verse
  paints a devastating picture of chaos, division, and pain.
