  <h2 id="intro">who is iyowa? ✦ . 　⁺ </h2>

  <p>
    iyowa is a highly celebrated vocaloid producer (for more on vocaloid, 
    <a class="link" href="https://laguardia-webdev-2024.github.io/2-p-unit-2-project-silly-camilo/" target="_blank">
      see my previous website)!
    </a> 
    he is known for his use of dissonance in his songs to create an incredible emotional
    atmosphere. many of his songs have themes of nostalgia and mourning the passage of
    time and loss of childhood. his songs are usually heartwrenching, a kaleidescope of
    striking melodies and poetic lyrics. additionally, he illustrates and animates his
    own music videos and designs characters for each of them! they're known as "iyowa girls"
    and he has a very beautiful and sweet art style. he makes use of limited
    color palettes to give each of his music videos an instantly
    unique visual identity. his songs on their own are so powerful,
    but alongside the music videos he truly connects with his audience and
    weaves a powerful narrative every time. it goes without saying that he is an incredibly talented individual!
  </p>
  <p>
    a fun fact is that his name comes from the phrase "<strong>i</strong> ga <strong>yowa</strong>i" meaning weak stomach. 
    his little icon and persona for himself is a simplified illustration of a stomach with a small smiley face.

  <h2 id="lyrics"> song info & lyrics analysis ✦ . 　⁺ </h2>
<p>
  the official english translation of the title “netsu ijou” is <em> 
  heat abnormal. </em> however, a more accurate translation would be 
  <em> thermal anomaly. </em> <br>
  for the vocal, iyowa used the UTAU 
  adachi rei! she gives the song a very crunchy, robotic filtered 
  sound, which is absolutely perfect for the themes and even setting 
  that this song explores! her use here gave her voicebank a lot of 
  recognition. <br>
  this song has become a huge sensation, garnering many 
  covers (across languages!), remixes, fan art / music videos, and 
  more! i find all of this to be extremely well deserved! it makes me 
  so deeply happy to see so many people connecting with this song 
  just as strongly as i do! time and again i find that the vocal 
  synth community is incredibly creative and talented, and the many 
  wonderful, unique derivatives of this beautiful song are even more 
  proof of that. (´ω｀) ♡
</p>

  <p>
    the popular consensus about this song is that it's
    about the end of the world.
    that being said, it's jam packed with devastating,
    poetic lyrics that everyone will interpret
    in their own ways! because there is so, so much to say
    about this song, i will keep it short and focus
    only on my favorite lines and what they mean to me! (´ ˘ `) <br>
    the credits for the translation i used come from the

<p>
  the song opens with this verse, illustrating utter loneliness and futility.
  it sets the tone that the singer is leaving messages for nobody. it's so interesting to note
  that the lyrics of the song begin with open quotations, and the song ends by finally closing
  them. this, alongside the imagery of a walkie-talkie in the music video, appear to convey 
  that the entire song is a recorded message, <em>"a pitiful soliloquy."</em>
</p>
<p>
  this idea of repeatedly counting dead variables makes me think of
  someone seeking solace in calculating different possibilities, even though they
  all ultimately don't lead anywhere. as you'll see many of the songs lyrics carry this same weight
  of futility and hopelessness.

<p>
  this song is full of repeating phrases at the end of each verse. 
  following the idea of the song being a recorded message, the
  repetition could indicate the playback glitching out or buffering.
  this adds to this feeling of abandonment and desolation built
  throughout the lyrics and setting of the song. <br>
  additionally the use of repetition serves to PUNCH ME IN THE GUTS EMOTIONALLY.
  there's just something so powerful about repeating a phrase in 
  a song that heightens the emotions SO MUCH and makes me want to bash
  my head into a wall!!!!!! it forces the listener to really FEEL the lyric 
  and all the weight and meaning it holds. its like the words are REPEATEDLY 
  PUMMELING YOU WITH AN ANVIL it's amazing.
</p>

<p>
  anyway on to the actual content of this verse. i just find it soooo ouchy ouch painful it's hard
  to even put into words but i will try!!! <br>
  setting fire to the flag of salvation again carries forward this idea of utter hopelessness.
  the people felt that their flag was false, that it couldn't be trusted, 
  and that it wouldn't save them at all. they are left with no symbol of hope to 
  look towards. <br>
  then there's the skeletons. there's so much to say here auuuuu!!!! I LOVE THIS SONG OMG ok so
  you would think skeletons are dead, but they're clearly still conscious. they come out of their
  coffins to celebrate the things they cherish, only to be filled with
  shame and try to behave as they should (which is to be dead) once more.
</p>

<p>
  obviously it's my own biased, silly little nonsensical interpretation, but i relate
  to these skeletons so much. this idea of trying to suppress yourself (<em>shutting themselves 
  in coffins</em>) and of feeling so much shame and self-depreciation (<em>there's something
  wrong with me</em>) is just so reaaaaaaaaaal. you can't help but be the self that you despise,
  even as you try to keep yourself in line. you can't help but live no matter how hard you try to die.
  <br> ouuuuuumygawd I LOVE THESE LYRICS ARGHHGRHRGHR
  i've heard many people agree that this song feels like a mental spiral, 
  and i agree so hard!! i find that the last part 
  of this verse could NOT be a more
  PERFECT encapsulation of that.
</p>

<p>
  ultimately the burned flag and the skeletons together illustrate a theme
  of death and blame. i think there's an interesting contrast between
  the people crying in a loud voice and the skeletons only speaking in
  a whisper. there's also the fact that the people are in a large
  group putting blame on something bigger than themselves, whereas
  the skeletons are isolated in their coffins and put blame on their
  own selves. perhaps it shows that in desperate circumstances,
  everyone experiences their pain differently. they might externalize
  it or internalize it, use it to fight or to weep.<br>
  there's also the matter of "salvation" alongside the 
  ideas of death. it brings to mind the end of times,
  perhaps an apocalyptic judgement day of sorts. 
  all this is to say that this verse
  paints a devastating picture of chaos and division.

<p>
  I HAVE SO SO SO SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS HOLD ONNNNN.<br>
  i started sobbing the first time i read the lyrics and got to this part.
  it impacted me so deeply AUGSHHGRHRGH 
</p>

<p>
  so immediately the <em>"hold hands and love one another"</em>
  is EXTREMELY striking as it's really the first mention of
  any sort of warmth, safety, and connection in the song!!!
  ONLY FOR IT TO BE IMMEDIATELY RIPPED AWAYYY. <br>
  we are INSTANTLY met with this theme again of utter hopelessness.
  the mention of killing unfulfilled dreams and ceasing thoughts and 
  unreality makes it seem as though this hope and love never even 
  happened to begin with, or perhaps is a fleeting and distant memory
  that can never be reached again. there's no sense in hoping!!
  it's a wistful impossibility, just like starting over with dead variables, 
  just like the burned flag of salvation, just like the skeletons
  resigning themselves to their coffins!!! THIS ENTIRE SONG IS JUST 
  DRIPPING WITH THIS LONELINESS AND HOPELESSNESS AND ABANDONMENTTT AND THEEESE 
  HERE LYRICS, BEING NEAR THE END, FEELS LIKE ALL OF THAT COMPOUNDED INTO 
  SUCCHHH AN IMPACT IDK MAN I CRODE SO HARD <br>
  you get just the briefest glimpse of love and then, fiiiiinally after everything, 
  you abandon all hope. WHAT THE NETSU IJOU.
</p>

<p>
  tying back to those skeletons especially, OUHHH MY GOD here's why i
  LOVE THIS PART SO MUCH .·°՞(≧□≦)՞°·. <br>
  <em>"as my thoughts begin to cease"</em> makes me imagine death, 
  all the noise is fading out, your 
  body will become cold. BUT INSTEAD, EVEN AS YOURE SUPPOSED TO
  SLIP AWAY, YOUR HEART IS STILL BEATING. <em>"A THERMAL ANOMALY 
  APPEARS INSIDE MY VERY CORE"!!!! </em>YOU'RE STILL HERE, ALIVE
  AGAINST YOUR WILL!! JUST LIKE THE SKELETONS THAT CAN'T HELP 
  BUT ESCAPE THEIR COFFINSSS!!!!!! AND THE FACT THAT THE WHOLE SONG 
  IS NAMED AFTER THIS , REALLY SEALING ITS SIGNIFICANCE !!!! <br>
  FINALLY, WHAT TRULY GOT TO ME, WHAT BROUGHT ME TO TEARS WAS
  <em>"THIS CAN'T BE REAL THIS CAN'T BE REAL"</em> LIKE HELLO!!?!? 
  THIS IS JUST THE LONELIEST MOST DEVASTATING THING EVER WHAT CAN I 
  EVEN SAYYYY. I. BRO!??!? <br>
  this COMPLETE disconnect from reality and yourself. feeling so trapped
  inside your body and your mind. iiii im gonna go sit in a corner <br>
  again this is why i feel this song encapsulates a mental spiral. 
  the devolution into feeling so completely lost and hopeless auugh,h,h, what if i
  cry forever!! !!!! specifically the refusal to accept this unbearable reality. 
  GIMME A MINUTE. <br>
  this is a common symptom experienced during panic attacks or as a result
  of anxietyy. and the way. this song captures it....
</p>

<center>
  <img src="img/PLOP.gif" width="5%">
</center>

<p>
  this song does seem to describe the world ending, but ultimately 
  it's evidently also about a complete mental breakdown. iyowa expresses both 
  ideas simultaneously, each strengthening the other, through his masterful use of 
  metaphor and symbolism. the lyrics, atleast to me, feel like an intimate glimpse 
  into someone's mental state as their hope is repeatedly beaten out of them. <br>
  there are soso so so so many more beautiful lyrics that help build on this, 
  that are sooo delightfully written auuuhhghgh auuuuu,, but i can't include them all 
  because this website will be ten billion years long if i do.... <br>
  i hooope if it interests you, you'll listen to the song and explode 
  for yourself!!!! YAYAYAYAYAAA
</p>

  <h2 id="why"> personal connection ✦ . 　⁺ </h2>
  <p>
    i find that this song applies so perfectly to so many different lived experiences. 
    that is, of course, how come it's managed to reach so far and to impact so many 
    people !!! OUUU IYOWA'S SONGWRITING POWERRR AUGHHH (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥  )づ♡ <br>
    personally, i find it rings so, so devastatingly true to the experience of depersonalization 
    as well as derealization: losing all connection with your sense of self and reality. this is 
    born of your brain being overloaded with emotion or trauma that it can't process, and as a 
    result, as a way of protecting you from that emotion, it just disconnects from them completely.
    doesn't this song describe that progression and experience so perfectly? the instances of 
    terror and pain keep building and building until finally, <em>"this can't be real, 
    this is unbearable."</em> <br>
    this is truly why this song impacted me so strongly. it just felt so incredibly true.
  </p>

  <p>
    but there's so much more!! continuing on this idea of disconnect from one's body and sense 
    of self, this song is also super perfect for a trans interpretation!!!!!!! auuuhhghhh i could 
    actually go on forever XD !!! <br>
    obviously many trans people struggle with dysphoria, feeling that their body doesn't align
    with their self. there's also so much loneliness to being trans, as you often feel misinterpreted
    by the world around you and that no one sees you the way you do. you also might feel persecuted 
    and shamed for trying to just be yourself. i feel that the song addresses alllllll of these emotions 
    so perfectly. auughhghghgh it. is. so devastating <br>
    as someone whose family isn't remotely supportive, the lines "i'll kill the dreams i could 
    never fulfill" and "there's something wrong with me, in a whisper" are just. <br>
    ༼;´༎ຶ ۝ ༎ຶ༽
  </p>

  <p>
    one last oneeee!! anyone who has ever struggled with self image is probably going
    to feel as MURDERED as i did by "there's something wrong with me" repeating EIGHT
    TIMES HELLO !!! (i bet you might start to see why these lines r my favorites... they 
    just r sooo impactful in all the ways i relate to them!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAA I LOVE
    ART SO MUCH AAAAAAAAAUGDHSHSH ^_^) as i've been describing, there are many ways that 
    the song appeals to the regretfulness, loneliness, shame and hopelessness of hating 
    oneself!!!!!!!! like there's this one part i excluded from my analysis but OUUU MY GOD
    it goes <em>"the fish that advises that there's virtue in letting go of happiness 
    swims in the sea of self consciousness."</em> LIKE ?????? ????? omggggggggggg
  </p>

  <p>
    i find that this song truly exemplifies the saying
    about art comforting the disturbed and disturbing
    the comfortable. <br>
    it has that trademark iyowa discordance that is so 
    wonderfully off-putting, and the whole song has such 
    an eery, tense, panicked sound. this style obviously 
    won't be for everyone, of course! like my brother, for 
    instance, who i recall describing this song as "buns"
    among other things. XD <br>
    but the reach and impact that this song has had, and 
    the emotions it draws out of sooo many people, show 
    that clearly it has such a powerful story to tell!!! 
    it has resonated in so many people's souls!!!! (♡ˊ͈ ꒳ ˋ͈) <br>
    i feel so lucky to get to experience this work of art. 
    i love the world.
